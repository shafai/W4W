After a close family friend died of pancreatic cancer, Andraka\n(then a ninth grader) became interested in finding a better early-detection\ndiagnostic test. He learned that the lack of a rapid, low-cost early\nscreening method contributed to the poor survival rate among individuals\nwith pancreatic cancer. After thinking further about the problem, he came up\nwith a plan and a budget to put his ideas in motion.\nStill a teenager, Andraka's groundbreaking results have earned him\ninternational recognition, most notably a 2014 Jefferson Award, the nation's\nmost prestigious public service award, 1st place winner in the 2014 Siemens\nWe Can Change the World Challenge, a 2014 National Geographic Explorer\ngrant, the 2012 Intel ISEF Gordon Moore Award, the 2012 Smithsonian American\nIngenuity Youth Award, Advocate Magazine's 40 under 40 award, and he's also\nthe 2014 State of Maryland winner of the Stockholm Water Prize.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Andraka was First Lady Michelle Obama's personal guest at the\n2013 State of the Union Address. He speaks to audiences of youths and adults\nall across the globe about his personal story, research, and his ideas for\nSTEM education reform. He has been featured in several documentaries\nincluding Morgan Spurlock's Sundance Film Festival entry, “You Don't Know\nJack,” Linda Peters' award winning film, “Just Jack,” Ken Burns' upcoming\ndocumentary about cancer, as well as 60 Minutes, The Colbert Report, ABC\nWorld News with Diane Sawyer, CNN, BBC, Fox, Rede Record de Televisão, and\nradio, newspaper, and magazine articles around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Andraka speaks at a wide variety of locations including universities,\nschools, technology organizations and corporations, hospitals and the\neducation sector. His audiences range from youth-children and teens through\nto adults in the science and technology fields.</p>\n\n<p>Andraka now lives in Baltimore, Maryland. He is a member of the National\nJunior Wildwater Kayak team, a Life Scout and has won numerous awards in\nnational and international math competitions.</p>",

She obtained a double degree in physics and chemistry and was awarded a PhD in Physics from Durham University, UK in 1992. Her Postdoctoral position was as a Research Fellow in quantum electronics at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, UK where she gained an international reputation for her work in the discovery of the '0.7 feature' and metallic behaviour in 2D Gas hole systems. In 1999, she was awarded a QEII Fellowship and came to Australia where she was a founding member of the Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computer Technology.</p>\n<p>Since then she has established a large research group dedicated to the fabrication of atomic-scale devices in silicon and germanium using the atomic precision of a scanning tunnelling microscope. Her group is the only group world-wide that can make atomically precise devices in silicon: they have developed the world's first single atom transistor and the thinnest conducting doped wires in silicon. She has published more than 360 papers in refereed journals with an h-index of 40 including 27 Physical Review Letters and papers in Nature, Science, Nature Materials, Nature Physics and Nature Nanotechnology. She has been awarded two Federation Fellowships and is currently an ARC Laureate Fellow. In 2005 she was awarded the Pawsey Medal by the Australian Academy of Science becoming one of the youngest elected Fellows of this Academy in 2006.
